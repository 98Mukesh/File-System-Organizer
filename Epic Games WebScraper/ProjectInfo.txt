We will be Creating an Epic Games WebScraper :

-> Project is based on Automation and Webscraping implemented


-> Features of the Project:

• Input : From Command Line

1. Automation Part : 
• Input name of a game in command line and it will redirect to epic games store, search the game and 
  redirect to the page containing all game matching with the input we have given 
  and fetch us the url of the current page.

2. WebScraping : 
• Once we got the url of required page , it fetches the required game 
  data (i.e, game name , game info , System Requirements , etc.) 

• Then we create a folder and inside that we store all the fetched data in a text file created with 
  the respective game name 



-> Libraries and Modules Used :
1. For Automation : puppeteer    

2. For WebScraping :
 • request
 • cheerio
